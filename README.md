# Edge-Inferencing


This repository is to be loaded onto a google coral dev board.  
We used the ASUS Tinker Edge T as our prototyping solution, but the standard google coral dev board can be used as well.

Requirements are loading PyCoral onto the dev board - tensorflow lite dependencies should be taken care of with this.
Installing flask, opencv and networktables (from RobotPy) will be required to run this particular program as well.

To run, simply go into the directory with detect.py and run python3 detect.py
